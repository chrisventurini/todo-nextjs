## TO DO APP
## Learning Next.js

As part of my challenge, I am learning [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) in order to be able to create an isomorphic React app.

This is the second part of my efforts. I have already gone through the [Next.js tutorals](https://nextjs.org/learn) and now I am creating a to do app based on what I've learned.  

As part of the commit...ment (pun intended) to the challenge, I am making all my code publicly accessible via GitHub and posting my progress on:

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChrisMVenturini)
* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/chrismventurini/)

This is my code as I progress through the [Next.js tutorials](https://nextjs.org/learn/).

#### How to build and run locally (assume you have NodeJS and git installed)
